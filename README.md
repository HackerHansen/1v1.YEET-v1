# 1v1.YEET-v1
A Cheat Engine hack for the game 1v1.lol 

### Current Status: Working (last checked October 3rd, 2020)

Patch log: 
 - Fixed on September 28th, 2020 

### Note: This has only been tested on Windows 10 64-bit but may work on other versions of Windows, and possibly Mac as well. This has also only been tested on Firefox. Also, having Badlion Client installed will cause Cheat Engine to not work. 

## INSTRUCTIONS: 

1.) Download Cheat Engine from https://cheatengine.org/ 

If you already have cheat engine, update to version 7.1 

*Cheat Engine tends to bundle useless bundleware, so make sure you read the installation window and make sure you are installing only Cheat Engine and not anything else if you don't want bundleware.*

2.) Download Firefox from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ 

3.) Download "1v1.YEET.CETRAINER" 

4.) Open a SINGLE tab to [1v1.lol](https://1v1.lol) in Firefox. Make sure it is the only tab running. 

5.) Go to Task Manager and press the "details" tab.

6.) Scroll down to the firefox processes and look at the process with the most RAM being used.

7.) Look to the left and look at the PID.

9.) Press "attach process." The program may freeze for a while, but it shouldn't take long. 

10.) Enable the features and destroy your friends at the game! 

### IMPORTANT: Please don't use this in competitive/ranked matches(the ones where you can gain/lose trophies) unless you are playing against your friends. 

## If this doesn't work, you may try the following: 

- Make sure you are on the latest version of Firefox. 

- Make sure you are attached to the right process. One way to do this is to enter a number in the "speed" box and press enter. If everything becomes faster, that means you are attached to the right process. Since speed will always work, this is also a good method to test if the hack is patched. If speed doesn't work, then you are attached to the wrong process. Try again. 

- Try a different computer if you can 

- If you have Badlion Client installed, you may need to disable its anticheat or just uninstall it completely, as it stops cheat engine from running at all, even if the client isn't actually running (for some reason). 

- Reinstall Cheat Engine
